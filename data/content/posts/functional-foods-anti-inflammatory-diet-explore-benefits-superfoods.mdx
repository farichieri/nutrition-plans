Currently, lifestyle habits, including diet, exposure to environmental toxins, emotional stress, sedentary behavior, and chronic use of certain medications, tend to trigger a process in the body known as chronic inflammation. This chronic inflammation can be the trigger and also the basis for many diseases such as obesity, metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia), cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune disorders, endometriosis, among others, or symptoms such as fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle aches, joint pains, hair loss, etc.; many of which can be caused by nutrient deficiencies resulting from chronic inflammation.

The anti-inflammatory diet has a pattern quite similar to the Mediterranean diet, based on vegetables and fruits with high antioxidant content, whole grains, nuts, white meats, fish, olive oil, avocado, spices such as turmeric, garlic, and ginger. Many scientific studies point to this diet as one of the most suitable for reducing cardiovascular risk and metabolic syndrome, showing its benefits by reducing chronic inflammation. In the prevention and treatment of diseases, adopting an anti-inflammatory lifestyle and diet is the best path we can recommend.

### But... What foods does the anti-inflammatory functional diet consist of?

The anti-inflammatory diet is based on consuming foods that help reduce inflammation in the body and provide essential nutrients while also offering additional health benefits. Some foods recommended to include in an anti-inflammatory diet are:

- **Fresh fruits and vegetables**: Especially those rich in antioxidants and vitamins such as vitamin C and E, such as berries, strawberries, blueberries, and broccoli, which help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.
- **Fatty fish**: Such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, known for their anti-inflammatory effects and heart benefits.
- **Probiotic yogurt**: Containing beneficial bacteria for the digestive system, such as bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.
- **Extra virgin olive oil and avocado**: Rich in healthy fatty acids that help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- **Foods with phytosterols**: Such as walnuts, almonds, pistachios, seeds like flaxseed and chia, and legumes like chickpeas and lentils, which help in the cholesterol-lowering effect.
- **Foods fortified with vitamin D**: Such as some cereals and dairy products, contributing to maintaining healthy bones and teeth.
- **High-fiber foods**: Such as whole grains, legumes, and nuts, which help regulate intestinal transit and reduce the risk of digestive diseases.
- **Green tea**: Containing antioxidants and compounds that can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
- **Dark chocolate**: In moderate amounts, it can have cardiovascular health benefits due to its antioxidant content.
- **Fermented foods**: Such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir, containing beneficial bacteria for intestinal health.
- **Roots like turmeric and ginger**: Which have analgesic and digestive properties.

These are just some examples of functional foods, but there are many more in the market. It is important to remember that including these foods in a balanced and varied diet is essential to reap their anti-inflammatory health benefits.

On the other hand, it is recommended to avoid processed foods, those high in saturated fats and refined sugars, and don't forget about alcohol! These are pro-inflammatory foods and beverages for your immune and digestive system.
