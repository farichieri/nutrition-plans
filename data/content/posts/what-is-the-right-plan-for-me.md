Choosing an appropriate eating plan is not something to be done lightly. There are some important factors when making this decision that should be kept in mind so as not to put our health at risk.

Currently, many people decide to start a diet basically because they want to lose weight as one of the main causes.

## **Basic principles to keep in mind:**

- My physical characteristics: Here it is important to adapt them to our age, height, sex or some specific conditions, such as allergies.
- My objectives sought: Specify them, since they can be physical, health or simply ideological food objectives.

Am I looking to lose fat, maintain my current weight or increase muscle mass?

Do I want to improve my current whole blood values or do I want to learn to eat better to perform physically in my sport?

Do I want to learn to eat so that I can choose the foods I eat better and not harm the planet or I just don't like selected foods?
