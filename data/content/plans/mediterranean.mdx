## What is the **Mediterranean** Plan?

The Mediterranean diet is a traditional eating pattern inspired by the dietary habits of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, such as Greece, Italy, and Spain. It's renowned for its numerous health benefits and delicious flavors, making it a popular choice for those looking to improve their overall well-being through diet.

## Composition of Macros

The Mediterranean diet emphasizes a balanced macronutrient composition:

- **Carbohydrates:** Approximately 45-55% of daily calories come from complex carbohydrates, primarily in the form of whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables.

- **Protein:** Protein intake accounts for about 15-20% of daily calories and is derived from sources like lean poultry, fish, nuts, seeds, and legumes.

- **Fats:** Healthy fats make up around 30-40% of daily calories, mainly sourced from olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish.

## What to Eat

The Mediterranean diet offers a wide array of flavorful and nutritious foods:

- **Fruits and Vegetables:** Fresh, seasonal produce is the cornerstone of this diet, providing vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

- **Whole Grains:** Opt for whole grains like whole wheat, oats, brown rice, and quinoa for a rich source of fiber and nutrients.

- **Olive Oil:** This heart-healthy oil is used as the primary fat source for cooking and dressing salads.

- **Nuts and Seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, and flaxseeds are popular choices, offering healthy fats and essential nutrients.

- **Fish:** Fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

- **Poultry:** Lean cuts of chicken and turkey are included in moderation.

- **Legumes:** Beans, lentils, and chickpeas are excellent sources of protein and fiber.

- **Dairy:** Greek yogurt and cheese are consumed in moderation.

- **Herbs and Spices:** Flavor dishes with herbs like basil and oregano, as well as spices like garlic and cumin.

## What to Avoid

The Mediterranean diet encourages limiting certain foods:

- **Processed Meats:** Reduce or eliminate processed meats like sausages and bacon.

- **Added Sugars:** Minimize the consumption of sugary beverages and sweets.

- **Refined Grains:** Limit white bread, pasta, and other refined grains.

- **Trans Fats:** Avoid foods containing trans fats, often found in processed and fried items.

## Advantages

The Mediterranean diet offers several notable advantages:

- **Diabetes Prevention:** It may help prevent type 2 diabetes by regulating blood sugar levels.

- **Longevity:** People in Mediterranean regions often enjoy longer lifespans, partly attributed to their dietary choices.

- **Improved Cognitive Health:** Some studies suggest that the Mediterranean diet may support brain health and reduce the risk of cognitive decline.

## Disadvantages

While the Mediterranean diet is generally considered healthy, there are a few considerations:

- **Portion Control:** Overeating, even healthy foods, can lead to weight gain.

- **Allergies:** Some individuals may have allergies to specific foods included in the diet, like nuts or seafood.

- **Availability:** Access to fresh, Mediterranean-style ingredients may vary by location.
