The first question we should ask ourselves before starting the ketogenic eating plan is how it works in our body to achieve one of the objectives sought, which is the burning of adipose tissue.

The Keto diet or ketogenic eating plan, has such a functioning that it will limit the consumption of carbohydrates to force your body to burn fat instead of sugar.

In traditional or better known eating plans, the macronutrient that will first be consumed is the carbohydrate, which will be processed and transformed into glucose to be used as the main energy source by your body, which likes to burn sugar naturally and that is why within a few hours of having ingested food, It demands food again, generating that much of the fat is stored and is not used as an energy source.

The Keto diet is going to propose limiting as much as you can, foods with a lot of carbohydrates (except those that have fiber!), moderating your protein intake and increasing your fat intake so that you use the main fuel that is fat and enter KETOSIS!

## **Lose body fat and many more benefits!**

Changing your primary energy source has incredible benefits, proven by science and backed by clinical experience.

That's why Keto helps you:

- Control your appetite and cravings
- Control your blood sugar levels, to the point of being able to reverse type 2 diabetes
- Improve your cardiovascular health indicators, such as lowering triglycerides and stabilizing blood pressure
- Improve your mental performance and reduce migraines
- Reduce ACNé️
- Increase your energy levels
- Reduce stomach upset

And it is also being studied as an alternative treatment for different diseases, such as epilepsy, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, attention deficit disorders and even different types of cancer.
Of course, if you have any disease or condition you should always inform your family doctor and do the corresponding checkups to make sure your body is reacting well to the diet.

## **How are macronutrients divided?**

In numbers, a diet is ketogenic if about 75-65% of your daily calories come from fat, 20-30% from protein, and only 5% from carbohydrates.

It is important to keep in mind that when we talk about carbohydrates, we are going to take the net and not the total carbohydrates. What do I mean by this? There are some carbohydrates such as fiber that are not processed by the body, so they would not add up as carbohydrates or as daily calories.

The equation that is made is Net carbohydrates = total carbohydrates – fiber.

## **How can I control my macros?**

It is important to note that Keto is a strict diet and there are no intermediate points: If you do it well it works, if you do it badly it does not work!

In the definition, we saw that 70% of your daily calories should come from fat, 25% from protein, and only 5% from net carbs.

To see if your daily macros meet those percentages, you should keep track of all your meals, what you ate, and how much. So, at the end of the day you could see if you met your goals for calorie count and daily macronutrient percentage.

## **What are the food groups used for the Keto diet?**

As defined above, it is mainly based on macronutrients divided mainly into a higher percentage of FATS, then followed by PROTEINS and finally CARBOHYDRATES in the best percentage of this diet.

> Try to vary between vegetables and meat over a long season, as each provides different nutrients and health benefits.
