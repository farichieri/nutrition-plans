The vegetarian diet has gained great popularity in recent years and has generated some controversy regarding this diet choice after eliminating meat and its nutrients. However, there are more and more studies that show that a "Plant Based" diet could be cardioprotective, unlike a carnivorous eating plan. A well-planned plan can reduce your risk of chronic disease, support weight loss, and improve the quality of your diet. In addition to the benefits of eliminating meat from your diet, it also has ethical and environmental benefits.

Some studies estimate that vegetarians represent up to 18 percent of the world's population.

A vegetarian diet does not include any kind of meat, poultry, or shellfish. It is a meal plan made up mostly of plants. These include:

- Fruits: apples, bananas, berries, oranges, melons, pears,
- Vegetables: green leafy vegetables, asparagus, broccoli, tomatoes, carrots
- Grains: quinoa, barley, wheat, rice, oats
- Legumes: lentils, beans, chickpeas, peas
- Nuts: almonds, walnuts, cashew nuts, hazelnuts, psittachos
- Seeds: flax, chia, sesame, pumpkin and hemp seeds
- Healthy fats: coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, avocado
- Proteins: tempeh, tofu, seitan, nutritional yeast, spirulina, eggs, dairy products if lacto-ovo vegetarian, such as plain or Greek yogurt, cheese, milk, ricotta

Vegetarians also do not eat products that contain gelatin or rennin (an enzyme found in the calf's stomach that is used to make many cheeses).

### **There are different types of vegetarian diets:**

- Lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet: eliminates meat, fish and poultry, but allows eggs and dairy products.
- Lacto-vegetarian diet: eliminates meat, fish, poultry and eggs, but allows dairy products.
- Ovo-vegetarian diet: Eliminates meat, fish, poultry, and dairy products, but allows eggs.
- Pescetarian diet: eliminates meat and poultry, but allows fish and sometimes eggs and dairy products.
- Vegetarian diet: Eliminate meat, fish, poultry, eggs and dairy products, as well as other products of animal origin, such as honey.
- Flexitarian diet: a largely vegetarian diet that occasionally incorporates meat, fish, or poultry.

## **Benefits of a Vegetarian diet**

A well-planned vegetarian diet can provide you with all the nutrients you need. Reducing the amount of meat in your diet can improve your health. Eating a vegetarian diet can help you:

- Reduce the possibility of developing obesity
- Reduce the risk of heart disease
- Lower blood pressure
- Lower the risk of type 2 diabetes by stabilizing blood sugar.
  Compared to non-vegetarians, vegetarians typically consume:
- Fewer calories from fat (especially saturated fat)
- Fewer calories overall
- More fiber, potassium, vitamin C, Vitamin E and magnesium

## **Possible Disadvantages**

A complete vegetarian diet can be healthy and nutritious. However, it can also increase your risk of suffering from certain nutritional deficiencies if it is not well planned or if foods with critical nutrients for health are not consumed.

Meat, poultry, and fish provide a good amount of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as micronutrients such as zinc, selenium, iron, and vitamin B12.

Other animal products like dairy and eggs are also high in calcium, vitamin D, and B vitamins.
When eliminating meat or other animal products from your diet, it's important to make sure you're getting these essential nutrients from other sources, from your diet or even through supplementation.

Studies show that vegetarians have a higher risk of deficiencies in protein, calcium, iron, iodine and vitamin B12, which some of these nutrients must necessarily be supplemented by because of the difficulty of reaching the requirement with food alone.

A nutritional deficiency of these key micronutrients can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, anemia, bone loss, and thyroid problems.

Including a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein sources, and fortified foods is an easy way to ensure you're getting adequate nutrition.

## **General Recommendations**

When following a vegetarian diet, keep the following in mind:

- Eat different types of foods, including vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and fat-free dairy products and eggs if your diet includes them.
- Choose fortified foods, such as cereals, breads, soy or almond milk, and natural fruit or vegetable juices to get a wide variety of nutrients.
- Cut down on foods that are high in fat, sugar, and salt (sodium).
- Include a source of protein in all your meals.
- If necessary, take supplements if your diet is lacking in certain vitamins and minerals.
- Learn to read the Nutrition Facts label on food packages. The label lists the ingredients and nutritional content of the food product.
