It is an eating plan that includes all the macro and micronutrients necessary for daily requirements, in adequate and balanced amounts and in which it will consist of a variety of foods from different groups so that the body obtains enough energy and nutrition to grow and develop properly.

For us here at **NUTRITION PLANS**, the key to healthy eating is sustainability and longevity. Traditionally, a "diet" in every sense of the word is designed to be short-term.

This type of diet is recommended for those people of all ages who want to choose a healthy, varied, accessible diet with all the food groups in a single day, without any restriction, following globally standardized serving recommendations for each food group. It may even be suitable for those people with pathologies or chronic non-communicable diseases, for the prevention of these or even for people who do physical exercise or athletes.

To achieve a healthy and balanced diet, specialists in the health sector recommend including in the diet all food groups, milk and its derivatives, meat, eggs and fish, legumes, fruits and vegetables, cereals, as well as fats and oil.

Likewise, they suggest increasing the consumption of fiber that comes from fruits or vegetables and whole grains; reduce the intake of saturated fats that come from butter or solid fats and replace it with unsaturated fats such as olive oil, as well as sugars and sugary drinks and opt for the use of sugar substitutes.

Another important point is to reduce the consumption of sodium, that is, table salt; consume at least 3 meals a day and consider 2 snacks and drink at least 2 liters of plain drinking water daily.

In order for our diet to be balanced and healthy, it must be rich in foods of plant origin, that is, include this group of foods on our menu every day to ensure the contribution of some vitamins and minerals that our body needs. In addition, they provide us with water and fiber. It is important that it is sufficient in:

**Slow absorption carbohydrates**, since they are our main source of energy.

**Proteins** for the synthesis of tissues, hormones and enzymes. They also contribute to the proper functioning of cells and the immune system, among other functions.

**Fats**, necessary for the good condition of cell membranes, to store energy, to maintain stable body temperature.
Fiber to regulate intestinal transit and take care of the bacterial flora. In addition, in slimming diets it is especially interesting, since it helps us feel more satisfied.

**Vitamins, minerals and water.**

All these nutrients must come from the consumption of healthy foods: Vegetables, fruits, vegetables, tubers, legumes, whole grains, eggs, fish, nuts, white meat and to a lesser extent red meat. And we must avoid or sporadically consume processed products such as pre-cooked foods, smoothies, packaged juices, alcoholic beverages, sausages, snacks, ice cream, chips, cookies, crepes, pastries, chocolates, soft drinks, breakfast cereals, fried and salted nuts, etc.
