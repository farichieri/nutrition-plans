title: "Gain Muscle Mass"

If your goal is to increase muscle mass, it is important that you be aware of the importance of the combination of physical exercise and an adequate diet for the objective. The correct combination between a good training plan and adequate dietary guidelines will make you obtain the best results and increase your performance to the maximum.

**How should your diet be to increase your muscle mass?**

If you have the objective of increasing our muscle mass, it is necessary that we provide an extra caloric level, that is, our energy needs will be increased since more energy is required to promote protein synthesis. We will raise around 400-500kcal per day in the eating plan.

This caloric increase in our dietary guidelines can lead to a weight gain of up to 0.5kg of muscle mass per week as long as we comply with the recommended eating plan.

In this eating plan you will find a percentage distribution of macronutrients: carbohydrates between 50% to 60%, proteins between 20 and 25% and fats between 20 to 30%.

Let's dig a little more into how our diet should be composed.

Carbohydrates: An increase in the consumption of carbohydrates is essential in our eating pattern. The options proposed in the plan: legumes, tubers, whole grains, rice, oats, quinoa, vegetables, fruit, whole grain breads, rice crackers.

Making an adequate recovery at the carbohydrate level will allow us to correctly replenish our glycogen stores, thus avoiding further loss of muscle mass (since protein catabolism increases).

In summary, the contribution of carbohydrates in our diet should be increased since in this way we will ensure a correct muscle synthesis and consequently a growth of muscle tissue. In addition, we will obtain a greater glycogen load in our muscles, which will allow us to optimize our sports performance.

Proteins: Proteins are an essential macronutrient in muscle growth, since they are responsible for executing different functions at a physiological level: They actively participate in the immune system, have a significant role in physical performance and, in addition, they also participate at a structural level in muscle tissue.

Although proteins are important molecules, they would not be essential as an energy source since during physical activity we usually obtain energy from other substrates, mainly from carbohydrates and fats, which is why they should not be exceeded or lacking in the daily percentage distribution, which, in this plan, you will not have to worry about.

It is important to prioritize proteins of high biological value such as eggs, meats, ricotta, and milk protein. In vegetarian athletes or who want to reduce their consumption of protein foods of animal origin, we can include legumes (such as chickpeas or soybeans) or other pseudocereals such as quinoa or amaranth, since these contain all the essential amino acids, but you will to find standardized on the vegetarian plan.

Fats: Fats also have their role in increasing muscle mass, they can be used like carbohydrates, as a source of energy during the course of physical activity. Even so, in strength and hypertrophy exercises, carbohydrates are often used as an energy substrate.

It is essential that we prioritize the consumption of healthy fats such as: olive oil, avocado, olives, nuts and oily fish. This micronutrient will help our body absorb vitamins, thus promoting proper growth and muscle development.

Do not neglect the importance of good rest for muscle recovery and hydration in this plan, which is calculated individually according to kilograms of weight.
