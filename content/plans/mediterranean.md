The traditional Mediterranean diet is a rich source of macro- and micronutrients and is considered a balanced and varied diet. When the term "Mediterranean diet" is used, it refers to the conscious adoption of dietary patterns (diets) that are typical of the Mediterranean region, but which can be practiced anywhere in the world and by anyone.

It has the following characteristics in its composition:

- Low in saturated fats,
- Rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly found in olive oil.
- Balanced in polyunsaturated fats (omega-6 and omega-3)
- Low in animal protein
- Rich in antioxidants
- Rich in dietary fiber
- Rich in a variety of phytochemicals (phenolic compounds, terpenes, and sulfur-containing compounds)
- Relatively low amounts of sodium.

Fats are an important component of the traditional Mediterranean diet. The energy provided by fat ranges from 25-35% of the total energy (calories). Although fat contributions of up to approximately 40% have been reported, while the energy provided by saturated fat is a maximum of 7-8%. Important sources of fat are olive oil, nuts, seeds, legumes and green vegetables.

The fat composition of the Mediterranean diet presents the following characteristics:

- High in monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, mainly from extra virgin olive oil.
- Balanced in polyunsaturated fats (omega 6 and omega 3). Nuts and seeds are an important source of these fats.
- High consumption of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fats (EPA and DHA), from the consumption of fish and shellfish.
- Low in saturated fat, due to the low consumption of butter, whole milk and red meat.
- Relatively high intake of short and medium chain fatty acids from goat and sheep milk cheese and yogurt.
- Absence of trans fats from industrial foods (eg margarines, fast food and bakery products).

**How to follow the diet**

The Mediterranean diet is based on:

- Plant-based meals, with only small amounts of beef and chicken
- More servings of whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes
- Foods that naturally contain high amounts of fiber
- Lots of fish and other shellfish instead
- Extra virgin olive oil as the main source of fat used to prepare food.
- Foods that are prepared and seasoned simply, without sauces or meat juices

What to eat on a low carb Mediterranean diet?

The low carb version combines two very popular eating styles: reducing carbs and consuming fresh foods typical of the Mediterranean region.
There is strong evidence showing that low-carb diets can help with weight loss and blood sugar control.
When following a low-carb Mediterranean diet, simply avoid foods higher in this macronutrient, such as bread, rice, potatoes, beets, and fruit with a lot of sugar (you can eat the above occasionally and in small amounts; We'll talk later about how to enter them).
The good news is that you can still enjoy generous servings of protein, vegetables, and olive oil at every meal.

**What to eat**

In most of your meals:

- Protein: Seafood, poultry, eggs, cheese or yogurt (consume fish or crustaceans at least twice a week)
- Vegetables that grow above ground, especially leafy greens, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, squash/zucchini, artichokes, eggplant, and broccoli
- Olive oil, olives, nuts or seeds
- Herbs and spices.
- Red fruits: one serving a day
  In smaller amounts:
- Red meat (twice a week)
- Processed or cured meat, such as ham or prosciutto (once a week)
- Vegetables that grow underground, such as carrots or onions (up to half a cup a few times a week)
- Legumes (up to half a cup a few times a week)
- Lemons and limes: in small amounts for cooking or adding flavor to drinks

**What to avoid:**

- Whole grains: bread, pasta, breakfast cereals, quinoa, and couscous.
- Potatoes
- Sugar, honey and syrup
- Foods with added sugar (sweets, cookies, cakes, ice cream and the like)
- Foods with white flour (bread, pasta, breakfast cereals)
- Sugary drinks
- Fruit juice
- Fruits: plantains (or bananas), grapes, and most fruit except berries.

**What to drink:**

- Drink still or sparkling water with a splash of lemon or lime juice, or coffee or tea with a touch of milk.
- Many people drink red wine with their meals as part of the Mediterranean lifestyle, but if you drink alcohol on the low carb version, try to choose dry wine over sweet red wine.
- Studies suggest that wine may reduce some risk factors for heart disease.
- If you drink wine, do not consume more than two glasses a day if you are a man or one glass if you are a woman.
