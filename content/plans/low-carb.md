The low carb diet or low carbohydrate diet is a diet that involves reducing carbohydrates to give preference to proteins and fats.

This type of diet stimulates the loss of abdominal fat more than subcutaneous fat, so you will lose, above all, the most harmful reserves for your health.
Although this diet will mean in many cases a decrease in body fat and total weight, what makes it more interesting for us is the effect on our metabolism and its impact on our blood glucose, which is recommended for those people who want to improve or treat metabolic diseases such as diabetes, insulin resistance, fatty liver, among others.

Reducing carbohydrates will help us regain the ability to use our fat reserves by feeling more energetic, improving our thermoregulatory capacity while normalizing our body weight.

Among other benefits found in this diet, we find the reduction of anxiety for food due to the existence of reduced appetite by consuming more foods high in protein and good quality fats.

**Allowed foods**

The foods allowed on the Low Carb diet are:

- Fruits and vegetables in small portions, preferably raw, with peel and bagasse, because the fibers increase the feeling of satiety and raise blood sugar to a lesser extent;
- Meats: Cow or veal, rabbit, turkey, chicken, lamb, pork, duck
- Blue and white fish: such as salmon, tuna, trout and sardines;
- Eggs and cheeses;
- Olive oil, coconut oil and Ghee butter;
- Walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pecans
- Seeds in general such as: chia, linseed, sunflower, pumpkin and sesame seeds;
- Low glycemic index fruits: strawberries, blueberries, raspberries
- Fruits with a high percentage of fat (coconut)
- Vegetables of all colors: always include spinach, broccoli and cauliflower.
- Water, coffee and unsweetened teas.

In the case of cheese, milk and yogurt, they can be included by controlling the quantities. Milk could be replaced by coconut or almond milk, for example, whose carbohydrate content is much lower. It is important to accompany the Low carb diet to ingest between 2 to 3 liters of water daily.

**Moderately Allowed**

- Fruits with a medium glycemic index (oranges, tangerines, apples, pears, etc.)
- Tubers (in a VERY restricted way potato, sweet potato, cassava, corn.)
- Rice (also in a VERY restricted way)
- Low-processed dairy: goat cheeses
- Dark chocolate: without sugar and with a percentage greater than 70%.

**Forbidden food**

In this diet it is important to avoid all foods that have a high amount of carbohydrates. For this reason, the nutritional label of the food should be consulted before consuming it. Some examples of foods to avoid are:

- White sugar: this includes soft drinks, fruit juices, brown sugar, sweeteners, candy, ice cream, cakes, pastries, and cookies;
- Flour: wheat, barley or rye including all its derivatives, which are present in foods such as bread, crackers, pasta and toast;
- Trans fats ("Hydrogenated" or "partially hydrogenated" oil stands out here): French fries, pre-cooked frozen meals, margarine;
- Processed meats: turkey breast, sausage, salami, bologna, bacon, ham.
- Artificial sweeteners: items such as saccharin, sucralose, cyclamates, and acesulfame potassium. You can use stevia to replace them.
- Others: pasta, couscous, cornmeal, oatmeal, corn, white beans, chickpeas.
- High glycemic index fruits: figs, grapes, banana, pineapple, persimmon, mango.

An important piece of advice is to try to avoid all types of industrialized products, since they normally contain a high concentration of carbohydrates, giving preference to natural foods that are as little processed as possible.
