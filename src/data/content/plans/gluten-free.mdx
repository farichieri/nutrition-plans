## What is the **Gluten Free** Plan?

A **Gluten-Free** plan is an eating plan that excludes gluten, a protein found in wheat, oats, barley, and rye, and which can also be found in other products such as medicines, vitamins, or supplements. Generally, adaptation to this diet occurs for medical reasons, such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy. You can also follow a gluten-free diet as a measure to lose weight or even as an option for intestinal pathologies, autoimmune diseases, or as a choice for an anti-inflammatory lifestyle.

## Disadvantages

While a gluten-free diet can be beneficial for people who have gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it can also have some disadvantages and health detriments in certain cases:

1. **Lack of nutrients**: By eliminating gluten from the diet, you may reduce your intake of certain important nutrients, such as fiber, iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and folic acid. This can lead to nutritional deficiencies if not adequately compensated with alternative foods or supplements.

2. **Higher cost**: Gluten-free foods are usually more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts. This is because gluten-free products require additional processing and because there is an increased demand for these products. This can be financially challenging for some people.

3. **Dietary restrictions**: Following a gluten-free diet involves avoiding many common foods and limiting food choices at restaurants and social events. This can make meal planning difficult and lead to feelings of exclusion or restriction in eating.

4. **Social difficulties**: Following a gluten-free diet can be tricky in social situations, such as meals at friends' or family's houses, events, or travel. It may be necessary to explain and justify dietary restrictions, which can lead to discomfort or difficulties in social relationships.

5. **Risk of nutritional deficiencies**: If a person follows a gluten-free diet without needing it, they may be at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies. This is because some gluten-free foods, such as fortified breads and cereals, can be important sources of nutrients such as iron and folic acid.
